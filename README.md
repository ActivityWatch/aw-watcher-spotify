aw-watcher-spotify
==================

Watches your currently playing Spotify track. This is on a per-user basis since it uses the Spotify Web API, so you don't need to run it on all your machines if you don't want the redundancy.

This watcher is currently in a early stage of development. It's not expected to work without a little tweaking.
